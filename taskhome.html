i just checked your code, it looks like a few elements are not aligned properly, and the radio buttons? tags? not sure how that works. the second one looks correct except the image doesn't load. also, do you think you could import the jura font and style everything in that font to keep it consistent?

Guys how's your cheat sheet going
I'm tryna fit this shit in it's just not workin
SavageGandhi â€” 11/30/2023 12:03 PM
Are we not ranking the task and categorizing it?
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 12:43 PM
im not sure about the details, that's something mon should be able to tell you more about
LagSpike â€” 11/30/2023 3:02 PM
Howâ€™d yall do
I got an 80%
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:08 PM

greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:08 PM
it was fair, not mad about it
LagSpike â€” 11/30/2023 3:09 PM
I should hope not who tf gets mad at a 96
Even my parents wouldnâ€™t get mad at a 96
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:09 PM
lmao no im talking abt the exam
like the exam was fair, not mad hard
LagSpike â€” 11/30/2023 3:09 PM
Oh yeah itâ€™s pretty reasonable
I guessed a bit more than Iâ€™d like
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:10 PM
most my answers were intuition tbh
cheat sheet didn't do crap for me 
debi â€” 11/30/2023 3:16 PM

i forgot what aggregation is lol
Morty â€” 11/30/2023 3:17 PM
Not bad for mostly guesswork
The cheat sheet helped for 3 questions and that's it
Then again I didn't fill it up to the brim with information like I should've
But my grade didn't drop like a nuke so I'm chilling 
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:20 PM
lmao did you just walk by me
at the skybridge
Morty â€” 11/30/2023 3:20 PM
I believe I did
Gray-ish jacket right
More like
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:20 PM

Morty â€” 11/30/2023 3:20 PM
White ish
Ur good
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:20 PM
yeah i hate it
i need a new one so bad
Morty â€” 11/30/2023 3:21 PM
I mean it doesn't look bad
At least you're not wearing two layers of jackets
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:21 PM
are you?
Morty â€” 11/30/2023 3:23 PM
I am
It gets hot lol
greeshie â€” 11/30/2023 3:23 PM
that's crazy i couldn't handle that for a minute
mon â€” 11/30/2023 4:24 PM

Morty â€” 12/01/2023 11:40 AM
looks good to me!
if anything changes we'll let you know ðŸ˜Ž
SavageGandhi â€” 12/01/2023 2:06 PM
Im gonna have to make a new class different from what we had in the use cases and the other diagrams
so hopefully it shouldn't completely affect our grade
greeshie â€” 12/01/2023 2:08 PM
i don't think they'll mind as long as we implement two new use cases and have a partially working final product
SavageGandhi â€” 12/01/2023 2:09 PM
ok its just that @mon made it look different from what I had so I have to change it up
LagSpike â€” 12/01/2023 2:10 PM
Do you guys want us to create a calendar or something?
LagSpike â€” 12/01/2023 2:10 PM
In the to-do list one here there's a space for one
Who's gonna implement that?
And what's this supposed to be for?

SavageGandhi â€” 12/01/2023 2:11 PM
yeah
greeshie â€” 12/01/2023 2:11 PM
